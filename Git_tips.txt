Here are a few tips for beginners to get better in Git use. 

1. Practise Git basics 
  Get an open hand in git basic commands like push, pull, add, commit etc and understand about terms like staging, branching, forking
  and their necessities. 
 
2. Don't try to complicate Git WorkFlow
  Unless required by circumstances, keep the git flow simple and easy to roll back rather than too much indulgence like forking or branching
  unnecessarily. 
  
3. It's ok tom make mistakes. 
  Everything can be rolled back.
  
4. Get through the concept of Branching 
  Important to save, edit and manage difference versions of same software. You gotta need to know about this.
  
5. Staging Area
  You need to know how to stage temporary changes before committing them because not all changes need to be committed and may have to be 
  rolled back sooner than you know.
  
6. GIT GUI
  In case, CLI is not your cup of tea, GUI interface is where you should go.
